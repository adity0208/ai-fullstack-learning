# 🚀 AI + Full-Stack Engineering Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Aditya — this repository tracks my daily progress toward becoming an **AI + Full-Stack Engineer**.

Every folder = 1 day of **hands-on coding** (not theory).

The goal is to build the real-world skills required by high-paying product companies:
- Backend API development
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Databases
- Deployment & Cloud
- AI-powered applications
